"""
Restructuring the company data:
 Suppose you have a dictionary that contains information about employees at a company. Each employee is identified by an ID number, and their information
 includes their name, department, and salary. You want to create a nested dictionary that groups employees by department so that you can easily see the
 names and salaries of all employees in each department.

 Write a Python program that when given a dictionary, employees, outputs a nested dictionary, dept_employees, which groups employees by department.
